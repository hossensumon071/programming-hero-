   what we lean from today 

   - Javascript is a hight level interpreted programming language. It makes the web pages more interactive. we can use javascript to make animations.
   - Varibale is like a box that store things, there are five types of variables number, string, boolean, null and undifined
   - javascript keywords are reserved words and they can not be used as variable name and function name.
   - Camel case, Snake case and pascel case are the three most common naming convertions.
   - Varibale names are case sensitive
   - we discussed four types of mathmatical operations: addition, substruction, multipication and division(+, -, *, /);
   - Shorthand mathmetical operations(+=, -=, *=, /=, ++, --)
   - we can join two string together using the concatination operator, +
   - change string to int, string to float and we can specify the decimal places using toFixed();
   - using the modulus operator, %, we can find the reminder of a division
